# Rust Shoplist

<p>First project in Rust, written with love and lack of experience !</p>

I started to learn Rust a week ago and I already love it.</br>
I know my codebase is a bit messy for now and I'm sorry for that :(

<h3>How to use it :</h3>
<p>- Follow the insctruction gived by the program !</p>
<p>- You can modify the shoplist with your favourite text editor, "shoplist.txt" is created at the location of the binary execution.</p>
